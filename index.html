        <h2 id="What_I_Am">What I Am, and Where I Want to Be</h2>

        <p>My vision in a professional and personal sense is to <strong>start a career as a market analyst</strong> in order to transform quantitative data into qualitative insights. As data grows exponentially in volume, variety and voracity,
           human understanding and utilization is still limited. Furthermore, a greater emphasis is placed on companies making “data-driven decisions” rather than just following instincts or hunches.
            Market analysts employ various data management techniques to collect and clean data, which can then be analyzed for key insights or trends. These insights need to be valuable to whichever audience they present to,
             whether it be for managers, key stakeholders, or even the general public.</p>

        <p>Whilst my first preference is to work as part of a team in a marketing organization, I also believe there is potential in working as an independent contractor for smaller projects. Whilst I have gained both technical
           and interpersonal skills and experiences in my commerce and computer science course, any form of industry experience would prove beneficial.</p>

        <p>From the lens of the graduate capital model (Tomlinson, 2017), there are various personal development areas that can be considered as strengths and weaknesses. In terms of strengths,
          I would consider my identity capital and technical capital to be my most employable traits. This involves packaging a compelling employability narrative, which shows potential as an employee.
            This is due to my knowledge and skills gained from my marketing science major here at Monash. The concept of marketing and promoting a product or service has many similarities to the concept of marketing myself as a brand,
            and as such I consider <strong>the ability to sell myself as an employee to be one of my greatest assets</strong>.</p>

        <p>My weakest attribute in the context of the graduate capital model would be the amount of social capital I currently have.
           Social capital is the ability to not only the strength and total number of relationships a graduate has, but also the ability to leverage these relationships to access new resources and opportunities.
            In terms of the relationships that can help me reach my vision, my pool of social relations is very shallow. Whilst I have been able to interview someone already established in the data analytics industry,
             I would like to <strong>continue to grow my professional network</strong> and gain more information about the corporate culture that market analysts work in.</p>

        <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
        <p>As a university, Monash strives to foster graduates who are both critical and creative (Monash, 2020). In BEX3500, I have been able to display and develop creative and critical skills
          throughout the unit as well as the major project: discussing and proposing solutions for sportswear company Nike to improve their economic growth.</p>
          <br/>
        <h3>Creative Analysis</h3>
          <p>Creativity in a commerce degree has a different meaning than creativity in a general sense. Being creative in this degree is closely related to the business concept of <strong>innovation</strong>.
             It involves the development of a brand-new approach to a problem, or a significant improvement to an existing solution.</p>
          <p>Constraints are important for innovation, in that they focus efforts towards a more clearly defined direction (Acar, Tarakci & van Knippenberg, 2019). Throughout the project, I have faced three main forms of constraints:</p>
          <br/>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Limited inputs</strong>. Throughout my commerce degree, there is always a limited amount of time in the form of submission deadlines, as well as a limit to how much information can be delivered
               in the form of word counts and presentation lengths. This allowed us to prioritize and focus on the most important issues of the topic first, and then work together to ensure the narrative flowed smoothly. </li>

            <li><strong>Specific processes</strong>. The major project required our team to complete a project plan before starting our work. This pushed us to first discuss and allocate a balanced 
              workload and helped to chronologically sort and organize an otherwise large task. Without the constraint of a project plan, our creative inputs wouldn’t align properly, leading to a disjointed and directionless result.</li>
            <li><strong>Specific output requirements</strong>. The project was evaluated in terms of a rubric, graded based on the quality of our project scope, problem analysis, and suggested solutions. 
              Having a clear form of measurement gave the project direction and served as a large problem that could be solved with smaller creative solutions, such as using a website for our presentation instead of a report or slide deck.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In my experience working through my commerce degree, creativity also <strong> needs to make sense to the target audience</strong>. In the marketing units I have previously undertaken,
             we have had opportunities to go beyond the typical academic essay structure, and create infographics, presentations and marketing plans that have allowed us to display creative problem-solving skills. BEX3500 has 
             also provided me a unique chance to interview someone currently in the marketing analyst space and ask about the skills and personality needed to enter the workforce. A form of creative thinking was required at almost 
             every stage of planning and running this interview; finding and sourcing an interview subject, formulating appropriate questions, and the actual interview and report. I needed to imagine myself in the position of the interview
              subject or the tutor, and consider if my conduct was professional and appropriate. </p>

          <p>Working towards such creative solutions has helped me understand my true boundaries for all graduate capital model components and has made me realize I may have more employable skills than once previously thought.
              This unit has allowed me to demonstrate and fine-tune a level of creativity in my projects that is innovative enough to stand out from others whilst staying relevant to my target audience. 
              I consider this unit to have further developed my level of cultural capital in better understanding what employers value in terms of creative dispositions. As I am sure my past assignments in
              higher education have similar standards to future projects as my envisioned career as a market analyst, I will try to <strong>emulate the same standard of work</strong> in order to align my behavior with the industry.</p>
          <br/>
              <h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
          <p>Being creative usually occurs either at the start of a project, or when finding a solution when a problem is discovered. Conversely, critical thinking usually happens <em>after</em> the solution is proposed.
             Being critical involves <strong>analyzing and evaluating options</strong>  based on certain criteria, ensuring a decision is made objectively and rationally. </p>
          <p>One common use of critical analysis comes from reviewing the work of teammates in a group project. In terms of team structure, our major project workload
             had a functional structure, where each member was given a distinct part of the presentation that didn’t rely on information from other sections. Near the end of the assignment,
              the project became more collaborative, with members applying changes and providing criticism on each other’s contributions. This aspect of criticism has been emphasized in previous units and team projects,
               and I feel comfortable in analyzing the work of my peers in a constructive and respectful way.</p>
          <p>BEX3500 challenged my views on critical thinking with the unit’s approach to introspection and self-evaluation. I already knew how valuable critical introspection was in providing goals and ways to improve,
             but the activities in the unit highlighted that it can be an inherently biased evaluation if not done carefully. One of the ways to have a more objective viewpoint is to <strong>use various frameworks to evaluate individual traits</strong>. We have used Tomlinson’s graduate capital model extensively, but even common marketing tools such as SWOT and PESTEL analyses can provide a clearer picture into who I am as a person right now,
              and what I can do to change. In this way, this unit has given me tools to bolstering my identity capital. The more I critically analyze myself on a consistent basis, the more I can continue to sharpen my narrative 
              to effectively convey my identity as a professional.</p>

        <h2>What I Need to Do Next</h2>
        <p>In order for objectives to be effective, they should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (Doran, 1981).
           There are three objectives that serve as necessary milestones to achieve my vision:
          </p>
           <br/>
           <h3><em>Objective 1: Complete the Industry Based Learning (IBL) placement in S1 2022, focusing on increasing social graduate capital.</em></h3>
        <p>I have been fortunate enough to partake in an <strong>Industry Based Learning (IBL) internship</strong> scheduled in semester 1, 2022. I have been offered a placement as a software developer for <strong>Nuance Communications</strong>,
           a multinational company which creates software for speech recognition and artificial intelligence. Whilst this position may be tangential to my vision of working in data analytics, I consider this opportunity as a chance to compare my current capitals to industry standards, as well as further improve them. Throughout the placement, I will further increase my cultural capital by having first-hand experience of employer expectations.</p>
      
           <p>At the end of the placement, I expect to have gained further knowledge of the IT industry, both in terms of software specialization requirements,
              as well as what personal traits and achievements are considered highly valuable in the workforce. I also plan to expand my professional network to include my mentors and colleagues,
               taking their unique views of their work into account. As the completion of the IBL placement also marks the completion of my university course, I will be able to <strong>leverage the benefits of my placement</strong> the benefits of my placement almost immediately.</p>
          <br/>
          <h3><em>Objective 2: Locate a position in the field of data science or marketing science within S2 2022, using the creative and critical skills learned throughout my higher education.</em></h3>
          <p>After my IBL placement finishes in July, I plan on applying to graduate market analyst positions in Australia. This will require me to use the skills and learning
             from both higher education and IBL industry experience. I will use my increased social capital in the form of the relationships made at Nuance Communications to ask around for any insider information on openings,
              or even locate a full-time position at Nuance itself. </p>
            <p>If I am able to secure an interview, I can leverage my already strong identity capital to provide my vision and employability narrative, marketing myself as an ideal candidate.
               I will also have some experience from the placement in terms of technical knowledge of current industry software, as well as cultural understanding of existing professionals in the analytics space, making it easier to integrate into the workplace.</p>
               <p>Even if I am unable to secure a position, there are still benefits to be gained from applying. Job application rejections can be a test of resilience and perseverance, to take feedback positively and constructively.
                  This will improve my psychological capital in learning to adapt to criticism, which is a highly desired trait in both professional and personal settings. Secondly, there is also the pathway of working as an independent analyst.
                   There are many open datasets available online in which I can apply my current technical knowledge. These projects can work towards cultural capital as an achievement in the marketing analytics field.</p>
                   <br/>
          <h3><em>Goal 3: Every year, evaluate my current knowledge and experience using the graduate capital model, and continue to adjust my current 2021 vision.</em></h3>
          <p>
            As I continue to progress further into my career, I should continue to perform self-reflection and evaluation, considering my strengths and weaknesses in my professional life and develop creative strategies to solve them.
             I can use the tools provided in BEX3500, as well as throughout my career, to think about my current achievements, and gauge where and how I can improve.</p>
             <p>
             Looking holistically in terms of professional growth, there are still many ways to enhance all capitals, independent of whether they are strengths or weaknesses.<strong> Growth invites change</strong>,
              and I should be open minded in how my vision may change to fit my values. Even after graduating and finding work, I wish to keep striving towards self-improvement both personally and career-wise.
